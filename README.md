# Module Three Data Study Lite

## Overview
Design studies are intensive, longitudinal, collaborative design activities. While they're a powerful tool in your visualization development toolkit, they also take a bit more energy than is reasonable for a module-sized assignment :-) To get you some practice with the design study methodology, you'll conduct a miniature design study with yourselves as both the designer and stakeholder. Your goal will be to design a visualization tool to support the following scenario: 

The US Department of Energy is conducting a review of historical data to try to inform next generation energy policies. They've hired your team to design a visualization tool for exploring their data to understand past patterns in the energy sector and generate data-driven policy recommendations. These recommendations can occur at the federal or state level and can consider information/data beyond that compiled in the provided dataset. The tool should support both exploration and communication for presentations to policy makers (in other words, they should be able to explore the tool and capture screenshots for inclusion in presentations justifying their policy recommendations).
